# Basic (QUASI and Wasserstein) Music Recommender

Used Quasi euclidean distance metric and the tweaked the implementation to see how well it works for this use case. Just for fun. 

PS: Quasi doesn't do exceptionally well, but it's decent. Wasserstein does a very good job, the results are almmost always what I would consider similar songs.
